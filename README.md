# Modelling Language Evolution using Statistical Physics

## Overview
In my Bachelor dissertation, I was tasked with modelling language evolution using a stochastic model provided by my supervisor. This repository contains the code and resources related to the project.

## Abstract

This dissertation focuses on the modelling of languages using Statistical Physics Methods and Agent-Based-Modelling. The research done by H. Kauhanen et al. builds the foundation of this paper. The model is a stochastic model that is concerned with vertical and horizontal transmissions (which are transmission terms coined by linguists) and a linguistic temperature representing the error rate. A simulation is developed using Python and tests different parameters as well as real life linguistic features. The simulation confirmed their theoretical results to the computational results generated showing that the isogloss density varies parabolic with against the frequency of features at different linguistic temperatures. Real life linguistic have also been plotted and their linguistic temperatures have been measured, from which conclusions can be drawn, such as the differentiation of the English words of ”hand” and ”fingers”. However, there is more to be discussed regarding the model, as well as the results collected.
